Description: Artificial Intelligence for Kinematics, Dynamics, and Optimization - Shared Library
 AIKIDO is a C++ library, complete with Python bindings, for solving robotic
 motion planning and decision making problems. This library is tightly
 integrated with DART for kinematic/dynamics calculations and OMPL for motion
 planning. AIKIDO optionally integrates with ROS, through the suite of
 aikido_ros packages, for execution on real robots.
